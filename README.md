## 🔬 ML Application - Weather-Based Energy Prediction

### Part 2 Implementation (June 2025)
The **ML Application** folder contains a comprehensive machine learning implementation for predicting solar energy export based on weather patterns:

- **🧠 Neural Network Models**: 4-factor and 5-factor weather-based prediction models
- **📊 Training Data**: Melbourne weather data + Adelaide household solar export data  
- **📈 Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation with 11 detailed visualizations
- **⚡ Solar Export Focus**: Specifically predicts energy exported back to the electrical grid
- **🎯 Incremental Training**: Efficient 50-epoch increments for optimal performance

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **4-Factor Model**: MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall, 9amTemp (traditional approach)
- ✅ **5-Factor Model**: Enhanced with 3pmTemp for improved afternoon solar prediction
- ✅ **Automated Workflow**: ML_4_Factor.py automatically generates ML_5_Factor.py
- ✅ **Advanced Visualization**: Complete analysis via `plot_refined_data.py`
- ✅ **Performance Tracking**: MSE and error rate monitoring across training phases

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd "ML Application"
python ML_4_Factor.py      # Trains 4-factor model
python ML_5_Factor.py      # Trains enhanced 5-factor model  
python plot_refined_data.py # Generates all visualizations
```
