# CORRECTED: Continuous 80%→95% Training Implementation

## Overview
Updated the ML.py script to implement **CONTINUOUS TRAINING** where the model trains on 80% then 95% splits WITHIN each interval, using a single model for exactly 500 epochs total.

## Training Strategy

### What You Actually Wanted (Now Implemented)
- **Interval 1:** Train 80% (25 epochs) → Train 95% (25 epochs) = 50 total
- **Interval 2:** Train 80% (25 epochs) → Train 95% (25 epochs) = 100 total  
- **Interval 3:** Train 80% (25 epochs) → Train 95% (25 epochs) = 150 total
- **...and so on until 500 epochs**

### Training Pattern
```
Interval:  1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10
80% →     25   75  125  175  225  275  325  375  425  475
95% →     50  100  150  200  250  300  350  400  450  500
```

**Key Point:** The model NEVER retrains from scratch. It continuously learns and accumulates knowledge from both training set sizes.

## How It Works

### 1. Continuous Model Learning
```python
# 10 intervals of 50 epochs each (25 + 25)
for interval in range(1, 11):
    # Phase 1: Train on 80% for 25 epochs
    target_epoch_80 = current_epoch + 25
    model.fit(x_train_80, y_train_80, initial_epoch=current_epoch, epochs=target_epoch_80)
    current_epoch = target_epoch_80
    # Save 80% results to CSV
    
    # Phase 2: Continue training on 95% for 25 epochs  
    target_epoch_95 = current_epoch + 25
    model.fit(x_train_95, y_train_95, initial_epoch=current_epoch, epochs=target_epoch_95)
    current_epoch = target_epoch_95
    # Save 95% results to CSV
```

### 2. No Retraining
- Model keeps all learned weights between phases
- `initial_epoch` parameter ensures continuation, not restart
- Each training phase builds on previous knowledge

### 3. CSV Saved After Each Phase
- After each 80% training phase → CSV updated
- After each 95% training phase → CSV updated
- Shows how model adapts to different training set sizes

## Benefits

### 1. True Continuous Learning
- Model experiences gradual adaptation between small and large training sets
- No loss of learned patterns when switching datasets
- Accumulates knowledge from both training strategies

### 2. Efficient Training
- Only 500 total epochs 
- No redundant retraining
- Progressive knowledge building

### 3. Detailed Analysis
- Results saved after each 80% and 95% training phase
- Can study how model responds to training set size changes
- Tracks continuous adaptation patterns

## Output Files
- `incremental_epoch_results_80_20.csv` - Results after each 80% training phase
- `incremental_epoch_results_95_5.csv` - Results after each 95% training phase  
- `epoch_differences_results_80_20.csv` - Prediction changes for 80% phases
- `epoch_differences_results_95_5.csv` - Prediction changes for 95% phases

## Research Questions Answered
1. How does the model adapt when continuously switching between training set sizes?
2. Does training on smaller sets then larger sets improve or hurt performance?
3. What's the cumulative effect of this mixed training strategy?
4. How do predictions evolve with this continuous 80%→95% pattern?

This implementation provides exactly what you wanted: a single model that trains on 80% then 95% within each interval, never restarting, and saving results after each phase for 500 total epochs.
